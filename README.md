### A basic template to get started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

It has been simplified for those starting out with web development and programming.

An [**example site**](https://project-33770.kodilla.com/) built with this template.

## Quick start

### How to download this template:

1. **Easy Way** - Download the `.zip` file
   * You can use the "Download ZIP" button in the right sidebar or click [this link](https://github.com/G-Wieliczko/project-2/archive/master.zip).
   * Unzip the template by double clicking on the downloaded `Project-2.zip` file.
2. **Programmer Way** - Clone the Git Repo
   * If you have git on your computer and a github account, you can clone this project from the command line
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/G-Wieliczko/project-2.git
     ```

### How to use this template:

1. Opening the template
     * If you downloaded the zip file, open the unzipped **folder** `Project-2` in a text editor  
     (e.g. [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)).
     * If you cloned the project using git, open the **folder** `Project-2` in a text editor  
     (e.g. [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)).

2. Using the template  
  
   #### HTML
     * Start with `index.html`, this will be your root page (the main page)  
       ```  
       *It's recommended that you delete the explanation comments in any new HTML pages*

   #### SASS
     * Start with `style.sass` inside the `sass` folder

   #### JavaScript
     * Start with `script.js` 
     * What's jQuery? It's a JavaScript library that allows you to manipulate your website much more easily with JavaScript
